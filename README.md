## How to Customize User Birthday
1. Open catpack.json in a text editor
2. Look for the section with "assets/jageruserbday.png" (should be the first one)
3. Change month and day for **both** startTime and endTime to whatever day you want

Keep in mind since this section is first in the ordering, if the date overlaps with any of the other ones it will overwrite it.
